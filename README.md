# Enigma-Machine
A slightly altered enigma machine, made in python! (W.I.P)

To use the enigma machine, type the text to be encoded in the encode.txt file, save, and then run main.py

Curerntly, only letters and spaces are able to be processed by the machine. This will be addressed, however, symbols will not be enocoded

Customization of rotor settings and plugboards are in place, and need to be added to the main.py file.
